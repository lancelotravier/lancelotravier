<!-- ABOUT ME -->
## About me

My name is Lancelot (yeah, it's my real name!). I'm 23 years old, speaks fluent French, English and Portugese and studying Statistics and Data analysing (Master 1). In two years, my ambition is to do a PhD in biostatistics. I started from the very bottom, graduating with a baccalaureate and no real prospects because of my bad grades and lack of work due to a severe ADHD untreated at this moment. After two years and a "covid" BTS diploma without any value, i choosed to go to uni to study economics and mathematics. After this, years by years, i felt in love with mathematics, statistics and coding. My excellent grades gave me the opportunity to do a master in Statistics and Data Analysing. Now i'm following my passion, and i'm the happiest boy in the world !

  <h3 align="center">You'll succeed in life and be the best of yourself the day you'll find the field you're really passionate about, so don't loose your motivation : hard work is the key</h3>
